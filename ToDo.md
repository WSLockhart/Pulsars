## To Do List
---

[Aug-30,2018]


* change how we write to file / print to terminal

* fix hotspot plotting function to replace scatter(x,y)

* resolve tension with Alexâ€™ plots

* Compare the three potential models for linking current density to temperature (J^2, spatial J^2, or constant temp where J^2 > 0)


Goal: Let the ratio of the amplitudes of the two peaks be A, and the phase separation of the two peaks be phi. We want to plot curves of constant A and curves of constant phi on a rectangle with axes theta1 (angle of observer) and theta2 (angle of magnetic inclination).
